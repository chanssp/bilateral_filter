# bilateral_filter

Done as a small project in the individual research at the Visual Computing Lab(VCLab), Kaist.
Bilateral filter created using Matlab, after reading a thesis called <Bilateral Filtering: Theory and Applications (2009)> written by Sylvian Paris and colleagues.

The two pictures are images before and after applying the filter using the source code.
